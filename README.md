This mod is an addon for TerraFirmaCraft and GregTechCEu Modern.
This mod adds 36 new ores for GregTech in TerraFrimaCraft world.

Each ore can only be found in a certain layer of rock.
These ores have TFC-style textures for poor, normal or rich types blocks.

This ores and TFC ores also can be processed by a macerator.
